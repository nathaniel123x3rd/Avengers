# Avengers Card Hover Animation

## Features

- **Character Cards**: Displays multiple character cards (e.g., Star Lord, Black Panther, Iron Man, etc.).
- **Hover Animation**: Cards rotate and move slightly on hover, revealing the character's name with a smooth transition.
- **Background Effect**: Subtle red background effect behind each card on hover.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for various screen sizes with a responsive layout.
